    \challenge_description{
        Challenges are a great way to learn new skills. They are designed to be selfexplanatory and atomic,
        making them reusable and mix-and-matchable in various learning contexts.
        Unlike lengthy tutorials, these challenges are meant for quick, focused learning experiences.
        This description should provide enough context—along with examples and figures—to illustrate
        how the skill being taught is applied in day-to-day life.

        Sometimes, a brief hint or warning is useful before starting the challenge.
